# 00001. Record Architecture Decisions initialization

2023-08-03

## Status

__Accepted__

## Context

Architecture for agile projects has to be described and defined differently. Not all decisions will be made at once, nor will all of them be done when the project begins.

## Decision

We will keep a collection of records for "architecturally significant" decisions: those that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques.

## Consequences

See https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions for more information about ADR's.
