# Architecture Decision Toolset

Architecture for agile projects has to be described and defined differently. Not all decisions will be made at once, nor will all of them be done when the project begins.
This command line toolset helps with creating and managing ADR's that can easily be added to source control systems like GitHub.

## adr-cli
A command-line tool for working with Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), based on the idea of [Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/authors/MichaelNygard.html) and his blog about [documenting architecture decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).


## Credits

This tool is an extensive rewrite of a tool by GingerTommy as a fork from the adr tools, a set of bash files.
